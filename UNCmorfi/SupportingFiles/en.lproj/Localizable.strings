I'm a Computer Science Student from FaMAF - UNC from Argentina.
I've been wanting to get into development in Apple platforms ever since I started studying. When Swift came out, I thought it was the perfect opportunity for me to get started. A friend of mine developed this same app for Android as a way to get started with Java and Android and I thought it was the perfect moment for me to learn Swift and develop an iOS version.
The app doesn't do much, it just serves as a client for data provided by the lunch hall of the University. It's just a convenient way to get this data from your pocket withoug having to search for various websites and typing in barcodes.";

He's a graphic design student with a lot of experience with mobile application design although his strengths are photo and video editing and 3D design.
You can get an idea of his work by viewing his |[Behance profile](https://www.behance.net/nicobacile)|.";

Both permissions are completely optional and can be disabled from the Settings app.";
